Jenkins
------------
it is help to perform automatic testing like continues initigration and continues deployement
_>continoues integration is nothing but we developers written a code in sub part we can comabin all the code here
   _.code-.build->integrationn->continue inegration
   ->code deployement->code-.build->integration->UAT(user acceptance test)-> Continudeployement
   
Why CI?
before CI 
3 developer code will store in git hub repositry then->move to integration-> testing
After CI 
We created one server that is only CI server
3devlopers code will store in git hub then it will rul all the funtions at atime like build test deployement
-----------------------------------------------------
What is pipeline
it is nithing but step by step excution
verion cotrol(github code will stored hree)
build(take that code and build it to conver jar file or war file)
unit test(testi g will done here is thre any error it will go back and again build the code till success)
deploy
auto testdeploy to production
after it will give production feedback
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workflow
--------
we can attach git,mavin,selenium,Aritifactry plugins to jenkins.thats why we have to install git maven java
once developer put the code github jenkines will pull the code and send to maven to build
once build the code and jenkins will pul that code and sent to selinum for testing
once testing is done.jenkins pull the cosde and send to arctifactory
we can also deploy with jenkins

jenkins master is divide the work to slaves
to give commuication between master and slaves we have to install some keys
According to lables the work will be assign
like l1->slave1 l2->slave 2

------------------------------------------------------------------
it is open sources and build in java
developed by sun microsystems.(saled to oracle)
jenkins based on plugin tooles,there are1000+ plugins in jenkins
it also support the cloud based architure.
ow to install jenkins using with yum ?
Create a instance _. connect->
First we have to check jenkins is there in our package or not
how we can check

 


go to the yum.repo.d directory
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
to check our linux details the command is
->cat /etc/os-release

after checking that
before installing jenkins we have to install java
when in server we didt have amazon-linux -extras
we can use these command
sudo dnf install -y java-11-amazon-corretto-devel
after that install jenkins'
and enter that passwords and install all plugins

Basic -> project->go to new item->free projeect->excute 

Now we have to install jenkins?
first we have to install java
to install java it is avilable in amazon-linux-extras
but extras packeage only avilabale in Amazon linux 2 only..not avilable in Amazon linux  2023
To install java _>sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
next step is 
Now we have to enable the epel-relase
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel
after thet we hve to move the file to yum.repos.d/
sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
now we have to install jenkins
sudo yum install jenkins -y
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now coming to 2023 Amazon linux proxcess isc
 create ec2 instance and connect-
 google -> jenkins->download with redhat links->
first we have to download a repositry  

->sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repos

after that we have to create a key
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

after that we have to install java with these link 
sudo dnf install -y java-11-amazon-corretto-devel

to check that java installed or not
java -version
after we have to install git in server jenkins
after we also install maven
Now we have to instal jenkins
sudo yum install jenkins 
to check that
 sudo systemctl status jenkins
 to enable the service
 sudo systemctl enable jenkins
 
now it is ready to use
goo to google
and paste ip address and along ith port number 8080
they give some password address
copy that path and past in cmd
password will come.
